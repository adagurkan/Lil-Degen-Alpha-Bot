# Lil-Degen-Alpha-Bot
This is an arbitrage bot designed to capitalize on liquidity imbalances in Polymarket prediction markets for risk-free profit opportunities.
Polymarket Arbitrage Bot
This automated trading bot exploits inefficiencies in Polymarket prediction markets to execute two types of risk-free arbitrage:

1. Rebalancing Arbitrage (Intra-Market)
When the sum of all "YES" probabilities (or YES + NO) in a single market does not equal 1, the bot buys a complete set of outcomes to lock in a guaranteed profit.

2. Combinatorial Arbitrage (Cross-Market)
When two markets are logically dependent (e.g., "Will X happen?" and "Will X not happen?"), the bot constructs a portfolio where at least one position is guaranteed to win, ensuring a risk-free profit.

Data & Pricing Model
The bot monitors Polymarket’s Polygon-based smart contracts, tracking:
